## The scared eyes

Fear is one of the primitive human emotion and, at those times, it was simply a survival tool. For this reason this emotion had to be transmitted in a fast and efficient way. One of those ways is through our eyes. Here we wanted to represent this particular using a scared face. 
When you are scared your eyes move frantically, your pupils shake, your irises often shrink.
